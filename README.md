# Identifying Mislabeled Medical Records with Machine Learning

### In late 2018, FDA had a competition for using machine learning models to recognize mislabeled genomics data related to RNA sequencing. An article in Nature magazine that laid out the criteria and, although we didn't have domain knowledge, we participated in order to utilize the teachings of the Cloud Computing Course.
