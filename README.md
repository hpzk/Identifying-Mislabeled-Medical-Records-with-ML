# Identifying Mislabeled Medical Records with Machine Learning

> In late 2018, FDA hosted a competition for using machine learning models to recognize mislabeled genomics data. [An article in Nature magazine](https://github.com/hpzk/Identifying-Mislabeled-Medical-Records-with-ML/blob/main/docs/mislabeling_correction_challenge.pdf) laid out the criteria and, although we didn't have domain knowledge, we participated for our final project.
