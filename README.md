# Identifying Mislabeled Medical Records with Machine Learning

> In late 2018, FDA hosted a competition for using machine learning models to recognize mislabeled genomics data. [An article in Nature magazine](https://github.com/hpzk/Identifying-Mislabeled-Medical-Records-with-ML/blob/main/docs/mislabeling_correction_challenge.pdf) laid out the criteria and, although we didn't have domain knowledge, we participated for our final project.   

> [Our results](https://github.com/hpzk/Identifying-Mislabeled-Medical-Records-with-ML/blob/main/Report.pdf) were not innovative due to insufficient domain knowledge, but it was a great way to apply our knowledge to large datasets (genomics data are perhaps the largest datasets) on AWS cloud and test results.
