# Identifying Mislabeled Medical Records with Machine Learning

#### FDA hosted a competition in 2018 for using machine learning models to recognize mislabeled genomics data. [An article](https://github.com/hpzk/Identifying-Mislabeled-Medical-Records-with-ML/blob/main/docs/mislabeling_correction_challenge.pdf) in Nature magazine laid out the criteria and we participated for our final project.   

#### [Our methods](https://github.com/hpzk/Identifying-Mislabeled-Medical-Records-with-ML/blob/main/Report.pdf) didn't produce leading results due to insufficient domain knowledge, but it was a great way to apply our knowledge to big data (genomics RNA sequence data are perhaps the largest datasets) on AWS cloud.
